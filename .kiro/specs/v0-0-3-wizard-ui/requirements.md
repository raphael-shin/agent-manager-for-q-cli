# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for transforming the current "Create New Agent" webview interface from a single-page form into an intuitive, step-by-step wizard interface. The goal is to improve user experience by breaking down complex agent creation into digestible steps, providing clear visual hierarchy, and implementing modern UX patterns like drag & drop and real-time validation.

The current UI suffers from information overload, unclear visual hierarchy, and poor distinction between required and optional fields. This redesign will address these issues while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Q CLI Agent Manager, I want to create agents through a step-by-step wizard interface, so that I can easily understand and complete the agent creation process without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Create New Agent" THEN the system SHALL display a wizard interface with 4 distinct steps
2. WHEN I am on any step THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator displaying current step and total steps
3. WHEN I complete a step THEN the system SHALL validate the input and enable navigation to the next step
4. WHEN I navigate between steps THEN the system SHALL preserve previously entered data
5. WHEN I am on the final step THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all selected options before creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visual distinction between basic properties, agent location, tools, and resources, so that I can focus on one aspect of agent configuration at a time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on Step 1 (Basic Properties) THEN the system SHALL display Agent Name (required), Description (optional), and Prompt (required) fields
2. WHEN I am on Step 2 (Agent Location) THEN the system SHALL display Local and Global agent options as distinct card UI elements
3. WHEN I am on Step 3 (Tools Selection) THEN the system SHALL display Standard Tools and Experimental Tools in separate tabs
4. WHEN I am on Step 4 (Resources) THEN the system SHALL display a drag & drop interface for file selection
5. WHEN I complete all steps THEN the system SHALL display a summary page with all configuration details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time validation and feedback during agent creation, so that I can correct errors immediately without waiting until form submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter an agent name THEN the system SHALL check for duplicates in real-time and display warnings
2. WHEN I enter invalid characters in agent name THEN the system SHALL display character restriction warnings
3. WHEN I add invalid file paths in resources THEN the system SHALL display path validation errors immediately
4. WHEN validation fails on any field THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation to the next step
5. WHEN all required fields are valid THEN the system SHALL enable the "Next" button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visual distinction between standard and experimental tools, so that I can make informed decisions about which tools to include in my agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Tools Selection step THEN the system SHALL display Standard Tools and Experimental Tools in separate tabs
2. WHEN I view Experimental Tools THEN the system SHALL display a warning badge and explanatory text
3. WHEN I hover over any tool THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip with tool description
4. WHEN I select a tool THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed description
5. WHEN I select experimental tools THEN the system SHALL display additional warnings about stability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intuitive drag & drop interface for adding resources, so that I can easily add files without manually typing file paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on the Resources step THEN the system SHALL display a drag & drop zone for file selection
2. WHEN I drag files into the drop zone THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the file paths
3. WHEN I add resources THEN the system SHALL display them in a list or card format with delete buttons
4. WHEN I add invalid file paths THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent addition
5. WHEN I manually enter file paths THEN the system SHALL validate them in real-time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern, accessible interface that follows VS Code design patterns, so that the agent creation experience feels native and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the wizard THEN the system SHALL follow VS Code color scheme and typography standards
2. WHEN I navigate using keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
3. WHEN I use screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN I view on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout
5. WHEN I interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate hover and focus states

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear action buttons and navigation controls, so that I can easily move through the wizard and understand my options at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on any step except the first THEN the system SHALL display a "Previous" button
2. WHEN I am on any step except the last THEN the system SHALL display a "Next" button
3. WHEN I am on the final step THEN the system SHALL display a "Create Agent" button as the primary action
4. WHEN I want to cancel THEN the system SHALL display a "Cancel" button that closes the wizard
5. WHEN I complete agent creation THEN the system SHALL display success actions (Open Config, Create Another, Done)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent location selection to be visually clear and informative, so that I can understand the difference between local and global agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view agent location options THEN the system SHALL display Local and Global as distinct card UI elements
2. WHEN I view the Local option THEN the system SHALL display a computer icon and "Available in this workspace only" description
3. WHEN I view the Global option THEN the system SHALL display a globe icon and "Available in all workspaces" description
4. WHEN I select an option THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected card with visual feedback
5. WHEN I hover over options THEN the system SHALL provide hover effects to indicate interactivity
