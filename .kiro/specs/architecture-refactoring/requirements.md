# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive refactoring of the Context Manager for Q CLI VS Code extension to improve code maintainability, performance, and architectural clarity. The refactoring addresses current technical debt including inconsistent error handling, scattered test files, over-engineered interfaces, and performance bottlenecks while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Architecture Structure Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this extension, I want a clean architectural structure with proper separation of concerns, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the codebase without introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is restructured THEN the system SHALL implement a clear layered architecture with core, infrastructure, presentation, and shared layers
2. WHEN services are refactored THEN the system SHALL eliminate unnecessary interfaces where only single implementations exist
3. WHEN dependency management is improved THEN the system SHALL implement a dependency injection container to manage service dependencies
4. WHEN circular dependencies are identified THEN the system SHALL eliminate them through proper architectural boundaries
5. IF a service has multiple implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain interface abstractions

### Requirement 2: File Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want a logical and consistent file organization, so that I can quickly locate and work with related code components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files are reorganized THEN the system SHALL consolidate all tests under a single `src/__tests__/` directory
2. WHEN the directory structure is refactored THEN the system SHALL organize code into `core/`, `infrastructure/`, `presentation/`, and `shared/` directories
3. WHEN type definitions are reorganized THEN the system SHALL group related types by domain rather than having monolithic type files
4. WHEN utility functions are consolidated THEN the system SHALL eliminate code duplication across services
5. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing import paths through proper re-exports

### Requirement 3: Code Quality Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues in the extension, I want consistent error handling and type safety throughout the codebase, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error handling is standardized THEN the system SHALL implement a consistent Result pattern for error management
2. WHEN logging is refactored THEN the system SHALL use decorator patterns or aspect-oriented programming for cross-cutting concerns
3. WHEN type safety is improved THEN the system SHALL eliminate any usage and implement proper type guards
4. WHEN runtime validation is added THEN the system SHALL validate external inputs and API responses
5. WHEN error messages are standardized THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful, actionable error information to users

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user of the VS Code extension, I want fast and responsive performance with minimal memory usage, so that my development workflow is not impacted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL cache file system operations to reduce redundant disk access
2. WHEN memory management is improved THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of event listeners and prevent memory leaks
3. WHEN file operations are optimized THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous operations for all file system interactions
4. WHEN batch processing is implemented THEN the system SHALL group multiple file operations together when possible
5. WHEN resource pooling is added THEN the system SHALL reuse file watchers and event listeners efficiently

### Requirement 5: Test Structure Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer writing and maintaining tests, I want a well-organized test suite with minimal duplication, so that I can confidently verify functionality and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test utilities are consolidated THEN the system SHALL provide centralized mocking and helper functions
2. WHEN test categories are separated THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
3. WHEN test data is managed THEN the system SHALL use consistent fixture data across test suites
4. WHEN VS Code API mocking is standardized THEN the system SHALL provide reusable mock implementations
5. WHEN test coverage is maintained THEN the system SHALL ensure no functionality is lost during refactoring

### Requirement 6: Build and Configuration Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the development environment, I want streamlined build processes and configuration, so that I can quickly start contributing to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build configurations are unified THEN the system SHALL consolidate multiple build config files into a single, coherent setup
2. WHEN bundle optimization is implemented THEN the system SHALL eliminate unused dependencies and minimize bundle size
3. WHEN development tools are standardized THEN the system SHALL provide consistent scripts for common development tasks
4. WHEN tree shaking is optimized THEN the system SHALL ensure only used code is included in the final bundle
5. WHEN build performance is improved THEN the system SHALL reduce build times through efficient configuration

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a user of the existing extension, I want all current functionality to continue working after the refactoring, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing VS Code commands and their behavior
2. WHEN APIs are refactored THEN the system SHALL preserve all public interfaces and extension points
3. WHEN configuration files are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing agent configurations
4. WHEN the extension is rebuilt THEN the system SHALL pass all existing integration tests
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the same user experience with improved performance

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want clear documentation and self-documenting code, so that I can quickly understand the system and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN architectural changes are made THEN the system SHALL update all relevant documentation to reflect the new structure
2. WHEN code is refactored THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive inline documentation for complex logic
3. WHEN new patterns are introduced THEN the system SHALL provide examples and usage guidelines
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL include migration guides for future developers
5. WHEN coding standards are established THEN the system SHALL enforce them through automated tooling
